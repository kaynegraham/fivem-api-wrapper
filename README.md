# FiveM API Wrapper (TypeScript)

A beginner-friendly Node.js + Express API wrapper written in TypeScript,
designed to fetch and expose basic FiveM server data for use in external
applications such as Discord bots.

This project is intentionally kept simple and readable, focusing on
learning TypeScript, API design, and backend fundamentals.

---

## Goals
- Learn TypeScript in a real backend project
- Build a clean Express-based API
- Fetch data from a configured FiveM server
- Provide a reusable wrapper for future integrations
- Practice API structure, typing, and error handling

---

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript

---

## Why TypeScript?
TypeScript adds static typing on top of JavaScript, allowing:
- Better error detection during development
- Clearer data contracts between components
- Improved maintainability and refactoring safety

This project uses TypeScript to build stronger backend and systems-oriented
habits that translate well to cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure roles.

This repository is a work in progress and will evolve as features and
understanding improve.

## Planned Features
- Configurable FiveM server connection
- REST endpoints for server status and player data
- Basic validation and error handling
- Clean, documented API responses
